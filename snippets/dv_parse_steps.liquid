  DinVeda Ritual Steps Parser
  Note: Liquid snippets cannot return complex data structures.
  This snippet is kept for documentation but parsing should be done
  directly in sections that need it. See dv-daily-ritual.liquid for implementation.
  
  For reference, the format is:
  Step1|Heading|Text;;Step2|Heading|Text;;Step3|Heading|Text
  
  Parsing should be done inline in sections using split operations.
